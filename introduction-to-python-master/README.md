Python is well-known as a programming language that is easy to learn. With a simple, expressive syntax, Python is refreshingly free of the gotchas and edge-cases that plague learners of many other languages. Python isn't just for beginners though! It is an expressive and powerful language that is widely-used by professional coders and shops.

In this course, Tuts+ instructor Derek Jensen will introduce the Python language, starting with the basics and laying a solid foundation for future learning.
