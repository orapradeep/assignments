    "Today we'll talk about \"scraping\": how to get unstructured data and turn it into something usable. We'll primarily focus on _web scraping_. Python has mature tools that make this pretty easy.\n",

    "1. Find the data you want on the web.\n",
    "2. Inspect the webpage and figure out how to select the content you want. This usually involves some combination of\n",
    "    - Viewing the source code of the page (especially if it is simple), and\n",
    "    - Figuring out the structure of the HTML parse tree.  This step is much easier with a something like __Chrome Developer Tools__.\n",
    "3.  Write code to get out what you want:\n",
    "    - If the page is very simple, treat it as a bunch of text => __string manipulation / [regular expressions](https://docs.python.org/2/howto/regex.html)__ in Python.\n",
    "    - If the page is more complicated (and/or written in good style), we want to use the HTML parse tree => __[BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) / [lxml](http://lxml.de/lxmlhtml.html)__ in Python.\n",
    "4.  Make sure it worked!\n",
    "5.  If your crawling problem is at all non-trivial, you will now have to go back to Step 2 to zoom in further -- or you'll have parsed the URL of a link you want to follow, in which case you'll go back to Step 1 to figure out how to parse what you want from the new target page."

    "This pattern of nested finds, based on tag type, id, and class is very common. It's so common that there are two a special convenience language for such traversals: [CSS selectors](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp) and [XPath](http://www.w3schools.com/xpath/) (which works for all XML, not just HTML). We'll be using CSS selectors, which are more common for HTML and easier to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "With CSS selectors, we can write the above in a more concise and expressive way:\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    tech_divs = soup.select('div#nouvant-portfolio-content  div.technology')\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "All selectors work like 'find_all'.  Some basic building examples of selectors are:\n",
    "\n",
    " - `'mytag'` picks out all tags of type `mytag`.\n",
    " - `'#myid'` picks out all tags whose _id_ is equal to `myid`\n",
    " - `'.myclass'` picks out all tags whose _class_ is equal to `myclass`\n",
    " - `'mytag#myid'` will pick all tags of type `mytag` **and** `id` equal to `myid` (analogously for `'mytag.myclass'`)\n",
    " - If `'selector1'` and `'selector2'` are two selectors, then there is another selector `'selector1 selector2'`.  It picks out all tags satisfying `selector2` that are __descendents__(*) of something satisfying `selector1`, i.e., it's like our nested find.\n",
    " \n",
    " (*) It doesn't have to be a _direct_ descedent.  I.e., it can be a grand-grand-..-grand-child of something satisfying `selector1`.  For direct descendents we'd instead write `'selector1 > selector2'`\n",
    " \n",
    "Let's just explain how this applies to our example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Let's start with the first half\n",
    "        >    tech_divs = soup.select('div#nouvant-portfolio-content  div.technology')\n",

We didn't notice this because the _outer_ `try` / `except` is also catching these.  So: Modify `get_tech_details` to allow up to 3 retries. <br/>Bonus points if you actually look what what exceptions `urllib` throws in those cases instead of a general catch-all mechanism.  Alternate type of bonus points if you figure out how to do it using the `retrying` package.  You can test these by throttling your internet on and off to simulate an unreliable connection."
